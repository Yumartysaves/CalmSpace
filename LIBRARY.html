    <h3>Mental Illnes by Mayo Clinic</h3>
    <p>Mental illness refers to a wide range of conditions affecting mood, thinking and behaviour; it becomes a diagnosable disorder when symptoms cause significant distress or impair daily functioning. Causes and risk-factors include genetic inheritance, early environmental exposures, brain-chemical imbalances, and stress or trauma. While there is no guaranteed way to prevent mental illness, early recognition, maintaining physical health, regular medical care and stress management may help keep symptoms in check.</p>

    <h3>Mental Health Conditions and Substance Use: Comparing U.S. Needs and Treatment Capacity with Those in Other High-Income Countries by The Commonwealth Fund</h3>
    <p>The brief finds that the U.S. has one of the highest rates of mental health diagnoses and emotional distress compared to 10 other rich countries.  Despite a strong willingness to seek help, many Americans face barriers to accessing and affording care.  The country also has relatively few mental health professionals and poor outcomes, such as the highest suicide rate and a very high rate of drug-related deaths.</p>

    <h3>Mental Health Research and Analysis by IHME</h3>
    <p>They indicate that mental disorders such as anxiety and depression are among the top 10 causes of global health loss. In 2021, about 13.9%of the world’s population had a mental disorder, contributing to 17.2% of all years lived with disability.  And, though many effective treatments exist, 71% of the global burden from anxiety could be avoided if people received optimal care. </p>

    <h3>Social Media and Mental Health in Children and Teens by Johns Hopkins Medicine</h3>
    <p>The Johns Hopkins Medicine article says social media can help kids by offering community, identity-affirming spaces, and support. But excessive use is linked to negative mental health effects, like depression, poor sleep, and emotional dysregulation, especially since high users may also face cyberbullying and social comparison. It recommends parents set boundaries (phone-free times, turn off notifications) and model balanced social media habits.</p>

    <h3>Mental Disorders by The World Health Organization</h3>
    <p>The WHO fact sheet explains that mental disorders are widespread conditions that involve significant disturbances in thinking, emotional regulation, or behaviour, and many people lack access to proper care. These include a range of illnesses like depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and eating or underdevelopment disorders, for which effective treatments and preventive strategies exist. However, most health systems remain under-resourced, leaving a large gap between those who need treatment and those who actually receive it.</p>

    <p>NAMI, or the National Alliance on Mental Illness, explains that mental health conditions (or mental illnesses) are common medical disorders that affect a person’s mood, thinking, behavior, and daily functioning; they are not a sign of personal weakness. It also lists major types of mental illnesses like anxiety, ADHD, bipolar disorder, depression, PTSD, psychosis, and more. NAMI emphasizes that causes are often a mix of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, but recovery is possible, especially with early treatment.</p>

    <h3>What is Mental illness? by The American Pyschiatric Association</h3>
    <p>Mental illness refers to medical conditions that involve significant changes in a person’s thinking, emotions, or behavior, which can lead to distress or problems functioning in daily life. It’s very common; over 1 in 5 U.S. adults are diagnosed each year, but most people with mental illness continue to function and can improve with treatment. Treatment is tailored and may include therapy, medication, lifestyle changes, and self-help, and recovery is possible. </p>

    <h3>The Mental Health of People with Disabilities by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</h3>
    <p>Adults with disabilities report frequent mental distress 4–5 times more often than those without disabilities. This distress is linked to worse health outcomes, limited access to care, and social isolation, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. The CDC recommends seeking help from healthcare providers, using coping strategies (like relaxation, self-care, and social support), and connecting with disability-focused mental health programs.</p>

    <p>The study titled “Disability associated with mental disorders” assesses the disability levels linked to seven psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, depression, OCD, dementia, and alcohol-use disorders, in a sample of Indian patients. It finds that all these disorders cause significant disability, with schizophrenia being the most disabling, and that disability remains substantial at least one year later for depression, anxiety, and alcohol‐use disorders.</p>

    <h2>Difference between Disabilities and Disorders</h2>
    <h3>The Differences Among Mental, Developmental, and Behavioral Conditions by Tryingtogether.org</h3>
    <p> Mental, developmental, and behavioral conditions all affect thinking or behavior, but are distinct: mental illnesses involve mood or thought changes, developmental disabilities affect cognitive and physical abilities long term, and behavioral disorders are about repeated problematic behavior that’s at least partly a choice.</p>

    <h3>Deciphering the differences between disability and mental health problems by ConnectAbility Australia</h3>
    <p>ConnectAbility explains that an intellectual disability is a lifelong cognitive impairment often diagnosed before age 18. In contrast, mental illness involves disruptions in thought, mood, or behavior (like hallucinations) that can occur episodically. They also note that people with intellectual disabilities can still develop mental illnesses, and that the two conditions should be diagnosed and treated separately.</p>

    <h3>A qualitative study on the stigma experienced by people with mental health problems and epilepsy in the Philippines by BMC Pyschiatry</h3>
    <p>Stigma towards people with mental health problems (PMHP) is known to have substantial negative impacts on their lives. More in-depth exploration of the stigma and discrimination experienced by PMHP in low- and middle-income countries is needed. Previous research suggests that negative attitudes towards PMHP are widespread among the Filipino general public. However, no study has investigated PMHP’s own experiences of being stigmatised in the Philippines.</p>

    <h3>9 Ways to Fight Mental Health Stigma by National Alliance on Mental illness</h3>
    <p>NAMI suggests fighting stigma by speaking openly about mental health and educating yourself and those around you. It encourages using respectful, person-first language and recognizing that mental illness is just as important as physical illness. The guide also emphasizes showing compassion and choosing empowerment instead of shame. It advises being honest about treatment and challenging harmful portrayals of mental illness in the media. Finally, NAMI reminds people not to internalize stigma and to practice self-acceptance.</p>
